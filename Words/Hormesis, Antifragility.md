Robustness is the ability to endure stress until failure.
[[Resilience]] is the ability to recover from failure.

Materials have two modes of behavior when handling stress. At first they are elastic, they produce a force countering the applied stress and are capable of recovering their shape once the stress is removed. This is flexible deformation. Then after a failure [[threshold]], they undergo plastic deformation, where part of their shape is permanently altered.

Brittle materials produce a lot of restoring force and they might not even have much flexible deformation, meaning that the don't allow their shape to change with stress, but once the failure threshold is reached, they crack or fissure, rather than deforming.

Some rare materials are pseudo-elastic. They have different flexibility properties depending on temperature. Usually having more restoring force the warmer they get. A consequence of this is that when they are deformed when warm, they will "remember" this shape when deformed cold. While cold they are very malleable, and if warmed up, they recover the shape that was "programmed" at that temperature. Then if cooled while under flexible deformation, it's like a spring that relaxes with temperature. Cycling such material between hot and cold states gives us a spring that behaves with [[hysteresis]].

In life, those who yield to stress while being able to resume what they need to do without stress are the least prone to failure. Failure is not just when you stop what you are doing, but when you give up trying something.

When a system has mechanisms that adapt to stress, these systems can be stimulated or conditioned to increase their robustness by exposing them to a low baseline of a stressor. This is called Hormesis. Physical exercise increases flexibility, speed, endurance or strength of the body. Background radioactivity reduces the chances of errors as cells replicate, and a fever can help defeat cancer, even if tumors don't produce fever. This is all things that train some mechanism in the body, although in large amounts would cause dysfunction. Too much effort causes muscles to rupture and inflame. Higher radioactivity causes cancer. Enough fever will cook the body until there's organ failure.

Without being complacent, it's in finding balance, imposing boundaries and being familiar with your limitations that you can be healthy and grow.
