Laziness is a false concept. The vast majority of people naturally strive to feel useful and respected by others and will attempt to help even when unsolicited and inappropriate. The word "laziness" is often used as a derogatory to arrogantly point out superiority over someone else and make people who might be suffering to feel inadequate. 

People might fail to act and progress, but it turns out it often is a response to trauma. Resentment de-incentivizes action, makes people unwilling to help those who hurt them, so making people feel inadequate or pointing out their incompetence is counter-productive and leads to self-fulfilling prophecies on the myth that people can be lazy.

Happiness in work often raises when people feel in control of their work and by extension, their lives. [[Agency]] is often the cure for procrastination, after other peripheral traumas are handled too.

Use your excuses as therapy. Humans without well developed discipline have a tendency to conceive of a problem in its whole, even trying to anticipate the unpredictable parts of a process and then fall overwhelmed by the tasks that must be done. This causes paralysis, inability to act.

When there is an obsession to plan, borne from fear of failure, instead of experimenting and learning with the process, this leads to Analysis Paralysis. People with perfectionist personalities are prone to this and it's also a pattern common in impostor syndrome.

The good news is that humans also are very good at rationalizing, finding excuses to make sense of the world, even excuses as to why they can't act. These rationalizations usually fail to come to the deeper insight of the fundamental problems in the mind provided here, but a lot of them are still good starting points and [[Heuristics]] about how to solve the problem even if that isn't clear during anxious mindsets.

Think about what you can do right now. Not what you should do, or have done. The actions of "should" are a fiction, hopes and wishes.

Write a list of what things you think is why something can't be done. Some of them might sound silly when exposed like that and if you feel like that it's great that you can just eliminate them from the list, but consider whether they don't point to some less obvious insight in relation to other things, or maybe a personal or emotional need you haven't realized yet. These excuses are the subconscious understanding of how to solve the problem. They are abstract like ideas in a dream, so their meaning or adequacy isn't obvious.

Now see if you can solve one and just one of these excuses. Maybe the one raising the most stress, therefore would give the biggest satisfaction to get out of the way. Or even the one that seems quicker to solve, so it isn't an excuse anymore. If more excuses arise for each of the items on the list, then make another list of the excuses for each excuse.

Essentially, what you are doing here is using your instincts to break down big problems into smaller problems. Eventually they'll be small enough or redundant enough they seem easy to sort out one by one. You don't need to think about how they lead to the solution of the big overwhelming problem. You just need to fix your mind and progress rather than stand still. As you do so, the big problems turn more clear or you might even realize they don't matter at all anymore.

The answer on how to solve a big problem is obviously to break it down into smaller problems, find the components of a process, work on them individually, so you can then assemble them into the general solution of the problem. But this kind of thinking is not clear when someone feels overwhelmed or distressed. Using unconscious instincts to assist in this is how the body was designed.

Think only of the current immediate task at hand. If anticipation is causing stress, then you can safely ignore it. You don't even have to solve all the small problems one after the other. If you are getting started in [[Teaching and Learning|learning]] this process, you might be undisciplined or have bad habits and you need to rest a lot. It's just like any [[Teaching and Learning|learning situation]]. Take pride and celebrate any small achievements that enable advancement. Today you might feel like just doing one thing and that's okay, but try to do two things tomorrow and see if it turns out it isn't as hard as you anticipated. You climb stairs step by step. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

Another part of procrastination is also a conflation between intrinsic motivations and extrinsic motivations. Burnout happens when your subconscious doesn't have a sense of the benefit of doing something for a long time. It feels like the reward for your efforts doesn't match up and so the brain produces a signal to stop all action until you can make sense of life again and this manifests as tiredness. This tiredness isn't real, it won't go away with sleep. I only relieves when you satisfy a need in the [[Hierarchy of Needs]].

When all tasks in a life's person are coerced or informed by other people or the environment, the extrinsic motivations, then there is no real purpose to life either. People need to analyse what really motivates them, what things they enjoy to see in the world so they can produce more of it. This is intrinsic motivation. Some hard tasks might be necessary as a stepping stone to enable the tasks that feel easy or enjoyable to a person, but when you never get the opportunity to step on that stone in timely manner, then dysfunction results.

This dysfunction is the body's signal to halt action, in other words, procrastination. People tend to use entertainment and distractions to numb the suffering and if these things aren't actually meaningful to personal growth, they turn into bad habits which worsen the problem in the long term. There's this contradiction between the natural need to stay stimulated and active and a mental pain signal that all activity is pointless. People become avoidant of progressing and growth as everything blurs together as the same sensation and time keeps ticking anyway.

The only solution to this to truly stop doing things. Don't sleep, be reactionary to senses of anxiety or let yourself become numb. Just try to be aware of your surroundings as calm as they are and what pay attention to what you are feeling. What are the sensations in your body and what it feels like emotionally, regardless of whether it is good or bad. Just exist. You can now consider what really interests you and what matters in what you are doing. If you don't have any concrete thoughts in your mind, it's fine, just let thoughts stream unhindered like visions in a dream. Untangle them like knots. They might be nonsensical, but trying to remember why they might have made sense before. Where did they become confusing.

Much like [[Teaching and Learning|learning]], it's a form of change and because of physical limitations in the brain, there's initial resistance to change that manifest as some sort of suffering. In this case, it produces boredom. If you get a sense of boredom by staying still, then you are doing it right. At some point the boredom will incentivise better thought patterns, as the subconscious regains confidence that it won't be overwhelmed.

You might get sudden inspirations to do some tasks or feel creative to fix things you couldn't solve before. These are fleeting revelations at first, so don't be too excited and keep the mindfulness exercise for a while longer. Maybe until real tiredness comes, where you seem like you would fall asleep. That's the time you can try following one of the inspired tasks, see how well you can do. Maybe not much at first, but it's a matter of repeating the exercise and re-evaluating the reasons why you do things. What do you really care about?

If all you care about is to just feel relaxed and unworried, of course your subconscious will jump to the conclusion of consuming entertainment. It's easy to be entertained without putting effort into it. But that doesn't really give satisfaction or purpose in life. It doesn't enhance your [[Agency]].  So think about it... what would really make you proud to tell people about yourself, if you could do it? What do you want a future version of yourself to look like?

Try to write down or draw a picture of yourself as an ideal person, in earnest, without considering limitations or what other people would think of it. Maybe not all traits of it are realistic, but certainly there is also a lot you can try out. The traits of your ideal self are intrinsically motivated. This can help you figure out a life purpose.

There are ego-driven thought and then there's confidence. A ego-driven person does what it takes to make other people validate them. Them might learn to do that by being people-pleasers, making them submissive and neglectful of their own needs. But they may also learn to be dominating or manipulative, like telling other about achievements they haven't earned or trying to make other people feel inferior in comparison to them.

The point is that this affects the motivations and therefore what people feel like they can do. The ego-driven person relies excessively on extrinsic motivation, while the confident person, is someone who found something they like doing, that gave them satisfaction, and could do it by themselves, regardless if others like to join them or even give appraise.

The subconscious makes a reward/effort calculation automatically every time you consider doing something. Things which you've been doing for a while that became an habit will always feel easier, regardless of their actual complexity. On the other hand, if you do something without a sense of utility or while being stressed about it, then you run into burnout. These are cases where the senses of reward and effort are distorted.

Under burnout the thing to do is to switch to a task that follows your purpose in life. Sometimes mixing up tasks, doing something a little different every time also works. Or maybe find ways to integrate socialization and fun into what you are doing.

Whatever it works for you, you shouldn't think about reaching a conclusion. Whether there is an end to your job doesn't matter. What matters is whether there is an end to the small part of a task you can do today. They say journey, rather than the destination, is what matters. Often it can be worse: trying to reach a destination wears you down.
